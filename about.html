<p>What is the atmosphere behind most material that teaches you about freelance design? Is it intimidating? Who does it include and exclude?</p>
<p>In my thesis, I am creating a community resource that educates folks on all things freelancing. I am creating a resource that feels welcoming, exciting, and accessible. I want to challenge the status quo of what the face of design often looks like, and create a space that designers of color can turn to for advice that looks and feels like us. As a first-generation Filipinx multidisciplinary designer, I know that an inclusive approach to learning freelance design would have greatly helped me on my journey to get to where I am today. 
Through my thesis, The Freelancer’s Journey, I want to make the freelance design space more approachable to students in college. Particularly students of color, queer students, and low-income students, who often already deal with high levels imposter syndrome, lack of mentorship, and networking opportunities. This will be a community resource where I am able to share my own experience, horizontally, with other folks who are exploring and learning about freelancing as well. I will be making this information accessible through a website and book that explains it all in an engaging and welcoming way. I know from experience that a guiding voice or helping hand that felt warm and welcoming would have saved me so much frustration when I first began to freelance. I want folks in the future to be able to have that and utilize their talent to its full potential.</p>
