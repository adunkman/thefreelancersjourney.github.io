<p>What is the atmosphere behind most material that teaches you about freelance design? Is it intimidating? Who does it include and exclude?</p>
<p>The Freelancer’s Journey exists to challenge the status quo of what the face of design often looks like, and create a space that designers of color can turn to for advice that looks and feels like us. Designed by Victoria Lee, a first-generation Filipinx multidisciplinary designer, it aims to give an inclusive approach to learning freelance design. </p>
<p>The Freelancer’s Journey exists to make the freelance design space more approachable to students in college. Particularly students of color, queer students, and low-income students, who often already deal with high levels imposter syndrome, lack of mentorship, and networking opportunities.

The Freelancer’s Journey allows folks in the future to be able to have that and utilize their talent to its full potential.</p>
