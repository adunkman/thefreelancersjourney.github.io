<p>Some clients don’t understand the difference between a logo, brand identity, and a simple illustration. You can help mitigate this by asking them what problem they are trying to solve with this commission. By understanding what solution your design will have to bring, you can then list a set of deliverables (and their respective quotes) that will best suit the client’s needs. Make sure to be as transparent as possible about exactly what you are creating by listing out details in regards to each deliverable.</p>

<p>What are their hard and soft deadlines?</p>
<p>Some deadlines are flexible, some are not. A soft deadline is often when a client would appreciate to have deliverables by, and a hard deadline means that you have to hand over the deliverables at the exact time or there will be repercussions on their end. It is difficult to negotiate with clients on hard deadlines because there are often outside factors that are affecting why they are giving you that date. Make sure that you can really stick to a hard deadline before you agree to committing to one.</p>

<p>Do they have a particular budget in mind?</p>
<p>Sometimes clients do have a budget, and if it aligns with your rates then that’s perfect! This is an especially tricky part of the process. If I find that a client’s budget is too low (less than half of what I usually charge), I kindly pass and offer to hand the project down to someone else in my circle that it may be a good fit for. Handing projects down is really important and can help a starting designer out with getting paid work for their portfolio! If they say they don’t have a budget, I try to calculate a quote based off the criteria I mention in the next chapter.</p>

      <h2>What are their hard and soft deadlines?</h2>
      <p>Say hi! Introduce yourself in a brief PDF and tell your client how excited and honord you are to work with them. Go over your process, when they can expect what, and what first steps they should take to get the ball rolling.</p>
