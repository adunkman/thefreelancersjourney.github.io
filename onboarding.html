      <p>Onboarding clients is the process of transitioning them into your business. This is a really important step of the process because it is where you familiarize them with your workflow, build trust with them, and get started on the right foot. Good client onboarding can lead to them trusting your design decisions, leading to less tension when the time to present your design comes. Here are things you should include:</p>

      <h2>INVOICE</h2>
      <p>Make sure that you list all the information necessary to pay you. Whether that is an address for a check, email for direct deposit, etc. Also make sure to clearly define the payment schedule and, if one was agreed to, the payment plan.</p>

      <h2>WELCOME PACKET</h2>
      <p>Say hi! Introduce yourself in a brief PDF and tell your client how excited and honord you are to work with them. Go over your process, when they can expect what, and what first steps they should take to get the ball rolling.</p>
