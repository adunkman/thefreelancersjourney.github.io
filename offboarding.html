      <p>It’s important to spend as much time refining your offboarding process as much as your offboarding process. By leaving your client with organized files, clear next steps to take without you, and documenting their feedback, you’re not only more likely to get a client that will hire you to work on retainer, but your business will spread much faster through word of mouth!</p>

      <h2>GOODBYE PACKET</h2>
      <p>Make sure to thank your client for working with you, tell them how excited you are for their project to launch. It may also be helpful to do a few slides of design refreshers such as going over different file types, or explaining differences like primary vs. secondary logos.</p>

      <h2>FINAL INVOICE</h2>
      <p>Make sure you get paid! If you were paid through a payment plan, don’t expect your client to remember exactly when to pay you. Stay on top of things and send that final or consecutive invoice during file handoff.</p>
