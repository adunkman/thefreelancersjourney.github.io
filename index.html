  </h1>

  <p>A community based resource that aims to share information about freelance design work from a beginner and student perspective. The Freelancer’s Journey is a low-pressure, no judgement space to learn about the behind the scenes steps that freelance designers make but seldom have the time or capacity to talk about.</p>
</main>


<!-- <p>Disclaimer that this was written by a college senior that is only four years into their freelance designer career! I definitely do not know everything or am any sort of expert on this topic. </p>
<p>I just wanted to create a resource that gave back to my community and shares all the knowledge and lessons that I’ve learned over the past couple of years. </p>
<p>Please take all of this advice with a grain of salt and feel free to recommend your own advice in the collaboration page and help this resource be a truly living, breathing project.</p> -->
